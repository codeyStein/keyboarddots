Simple budget build came out pretty good! While it sounds very decent for the price I still find it a bit hollow, so maybe adding a sheet of foam should fix that, might try that later though. I'm honestly suprised of how well the switches feel stock, they're super smooth and in terms of sound they're relativly similar to milky yellows.
