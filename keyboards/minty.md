simple and budget friendly (in my oppinion). And from a beginner's point of view: very good if you want to get into the hobby. In terms of sound, I am thought I wouldn't like the sound that that ABS plastic case would produce but I'm very very satisfied with how it turned out. And I also somehow actually enjoyed lubing the switches!
